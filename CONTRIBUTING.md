# Contributing Guidelines

*Please note that this document is a Work In Progress (WIP) and subject to change without warning!*

This document specifies contribution guidelines and processes individual contributors should follow when submitting changes to this project.

## GitHub

Please create a **personal branch** for development purposes:

```bash
  $ git checkout -b [YOUR_BRANCH]
```

Alternatively, you can fork **master** branch. From there you can create a **local personal branch** (or make changes directly to your **fork master**) submitting PR's from your fork when ready.

PR's will be reviewed and commits to your **personal branch** will be merged into **master** pending approval.

Commit messages adhere to the conventions specified in: https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli.
 
Commits themselves run through a pre-commit testing and validation process to help ensure commit quality and codebase integrity. 

## Changelog

Please document all changes you make to `CHANGELOG.md` which is available in the project root.

Please specify version changes in `package.json`.
